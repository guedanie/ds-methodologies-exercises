    "## About the module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning methodology for grouping and identifing similar objects, people, or observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is often used as a preprocessing or an exploratory step in the data science pipeline. This is because the cluster that each item is assigned to becomes a feature for a supervised model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, you will be introduced to various clustering algorithms and learn why and when to use them. You will learn how to use clustering methods to identify similar groups using Python and Scikit-Learn. You will learn how to apply these clusters further down the pipeline.\n",

    "## Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Understand how clustering is used across multiple industries and use cases.\n",
    "    * Understand how the k-means clustering algorithm works.\n",
    "    * Understand how to use k-means clustering in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Cluster observations of a dataset into meaningful groups.\n",
    "    * Methods for estimating parameters for the clustering algorithm.\n",
    "    * Use clustering as a pre-processing step: Creating a feature that labels each observation into a cluster. These clusters are significant drivers of a target outcome you wish to predict.\n",

    "3. Methods/Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "    * sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances\n",
